yolo multi threading for 100 camera on gpu at high speed

keep on adding the test.py or any python file inside a cuda enabled open cv environment i have tested it for 50 cameras you can test it for 200
if you have a powerfull gpu by changing video capture webcam id and rtsp sockets and videos

here is the tutorial on how to compile open cv for cuda and and my tutorial tells how to 
make gpu compiled open cv available in virtual environment please
put the weights file of yolov4 yolov5 yolov6 yolov7 in testing.py code and place cfg and 
weights corresponding to each testing1.py testing2.py ,,,testing_n.py upto
the gpu usage i hope you people understand this is the simple method for multi threading 
any python code and gpu(cuda) based code here is the tutorial how to 
opencv compile for gpu if you dont know how to compile it in windows use 
this website which opencv cuda precompiled and please support me by subscrbing 
to the channel
